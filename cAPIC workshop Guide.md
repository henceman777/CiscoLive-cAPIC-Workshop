### Task 0:
Import the libraires and define the main method 

	#!/usr/bin/env python
	import requests
	import cobra.mit.access
	import cobra.mit.session
	import cobra.mit.request
	import cobra.model.pol

    	This function creates the new Tenant with a VRF, CloudCtx Profile, Contracts and Cloud App.
    	"""
		print ("Main method")
	
	if __name__ == '__main__':
    	main()
    	
On the console:

	python workshop.py

Make sure there are no errors

Continue editing workshop.py

### Task 1:
#### Create a session to the cloud 
In main method:

	def main():
    """
    This function creates the new Tenant with a VRF, CloudCtx Profile, COntracts and Cloud APp.
    """
    # create a session and define the root
    	requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()
    	auth = cobra.mit.session.LoginSession(URL, LOGIN, PASSWORD)
    	session = cobra.mit.access.MoDirectory(auth)
    	session.login()
On the console:

	python workshop.py

Make sure there are no errors

### Task 2:
#### Tenant
A Tenant is a container for all network, security, troubleshooting and L4 â€“ 7 service policies.   Tenant resources are isolated from each other, allowing management by different administrators. 


In this task, you will first ckeck if the Tenant exists

Edit <em>variables.py</em>

	# Tenant Name
	TENANT = "cl-workshop"
	
Continue editing <em>workshop.py</em>

	def test_tenant(tenant_name, apic_session):
    	"""
    	This function tests if the desired Tenant name is already in use.
    	If the name is already in use, it will exit the script early.

    	:param tenant_name: The new Tenant's name
    	:param apic_session: An established session with the cloud APIC
    	"""
    	# build query for existing tenants
    	tenant_query = cobra.mit.request.ClassQuery('fvTenant')
    	tenant_query.propFilter = 'eq(fvTenant.name, "{}")'.format(tenant_name)

    	# test for truthiness
    	if apic_session.query(tenant_query):
        		print("\nTenant {} has already been created on the cloud APIC\n".format(tenant_name))


	def main():
		"""
		This function creates the new Tenant with a VRF, CloudCtx Profile, COntracts and Cloud APp.
		"""
		# create a session and define the root
		requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()
		auth = cobra.mit.session.LoginSession(URL, LOGIN, PASSWORD)
		session = cobra.mit.access.MoDirectory(auth)
		session.login()

		root = cobra.model.pol.Uni('')

		# test if tenant name is already in use
		test_tenant(TENANT, session)



On the console:

	python workshop.py

Make sure there are no errors

You will see an output that this tenant has already been created 

Next you will create a Tenant managed object (MO) and commit it to Cloud APIC

<em>This is to test the idempotency of Cloud APIC</em>


Continue editing <em>workshop.py</em>
	
	def main():
    	"""
    	This function creates the new Tenant with a VRF, CloudCtx Profile, COntracts and Cloud APp.
    	"""

    	tenant = cobra.model.fv.Tenant(root, name=TENANT)

    	#submit the configuration to the apic and print a success message
    	config_request = cobra.mit.request.ConfigRequest()

    	config_request.addMo(tenant)

    	session.commit(config_request)

    	config_data = json.loads(config_request.data)

    	print("\nNew Objects created:\n\n{}\n".format(json.dumps(config_data, indent=4, sort_keys=True)))

	if __name__ == '__main__':
    	main()
On the console:

	python workshop.py
	
You should see a json output with the tenant name and the parameters you put in


	
Now you have a hang of it. Let's march on

### Task 3:
#### Create a VRF
Private networks (also called VRFs or contexts) are defined within a tenant to allow isolated and potentially overlapping IP address space

VRF is a child object of a tenant. 

Edit <em>variables.py</em>
	
	#VRF Name
	VRF = "user-vrf-{usernumber}" #input your user number

Continue editing <em>workshop.tf</em>
Define a method <em>create_vrf</em> and call it in main after the tenant object has been created
	
	def create_vrf(tenant):    
    	# create a VRF 
    	vrf = cobra.model.fv.Ctx(tenant, name=VRF)
    
	def main():
	
		#
		#  Your previous code here
		#
	
		# Creating a VRF give you the ability to have unique forwarding and application policy domain 
    	# and have overlapping overlapping IP address in the same tenant
    	# In case of cloud APIC, VRF maps to an AWS VPC
    	# VRF is a child of a Tenant
    	create_vrf(tenant)
	
		#submit the configuration to the apic and print a success message
		# Code here ...
	
On the console:

	python workshop.py
	
You should see a json output with the tenant, vrf and other objects.


	
### Task 4:

Continue editing <em>workshop.py</em>

Define a method create_cloud_ctx_profile(tenant)and call it in main after the tenant object has been created

	def create_cloud_ctx_profile(tenant):

    	#create a Cloud Context Profile for the tenant
    	cloud_ctx_profile = cobra.model.cloud.CtxProfile(tenant, name=CLOUDCTXPROFILE)


	def main():
	
		#
		#  Your previous code here
		#
	
	    # Cloud Context Profile is a new class in ACI which ties the AWS Regions, CIDRs and Subnets to a VRF
    	# Cloud Context Profile is a child of a Tenant
    	# Cloud Context Profile needs to be associated to a VRF 
    	create_cloud_ctx_profile(tenant)
